Simple Lookup Service (sLS)
---------------------------

The Simple Lookup Service(sLS) is a REST/JSON based lookup service written in Java.

It registers collections of key-value pairs referred as "records". The records will remain in the lookup service for a stipulated amount of time, known as "lease" time. Clients can renew the lease before it expires. If a client does not renew the lease, the record is automatically removed from the loookup service. A client can also explicitly delete a record.

In addition, a lookup service may also subscribe to another lookup service. When a lookup service subscribes to another lookup service, from that point onwards, the former will automatically receive new record registrations or updates to existing records from the latter.

The Simple Lookup Service can be deployed as a single centralized node or in a distributed fashion.
